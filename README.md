# Tensorflow Projects
In this github folder there are python 3 based tensorflow scripts that have a focus on image classification. 
## Binary Class Image
This python script depends on TensorFlow v1.0 and is a Jupyter Notebook file. The goal is to take images from two directories, "test_images" and "train_images" and then pull them into a logistic model that attempts to assign one of two labels to the images. There is an additional script "form_pics.py" that will auto format pictures (keeping the originals).
